#### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Challenge**: Implementing smooth animations and transitions
- **Solution**: Utilized Tailwind CSS's transition utilities and custom animations
- **Challenge**: Mobile responsiveness across different devices
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive design patterns using Tailwind's breakpoint system

### 2. Assessment System Development
The assessment system was built to handle both coding and non-coding assessments with the following features:

- Sidebar navigation with collapsible menu
- Difficulty level indicators
- Assessment type categorization
- Interactive UI elements
- Mobile-responsive design

#### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Challenge**: State management for sidebar expansion
- **Solution**: Implemented React state management with proper event handlers
- **Challenge**: Mobile menu implementation
- **Solution**: Created a responsive mobile menu with smooth transitions
- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent UI across different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Used Tailwind's responsive classes and custom breakpoints

### 3. Rich Text Editor Integration
The platform incorporates TipTap for rich text editing capabilities:

- Custom toolbar with formatting options
- Support for headings and basic text formatting
- Real-time preview
- Mobile-friendly interface

#### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Challenge**: TipTap dependency management
- **Solution**: Properly configured dependencies in package.json
- **Challenge**: Mobile responsiveness of the editor
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive design patterns for the editor interface

## Deployment Process
The project is deployed on Vercel with the following configuration:
